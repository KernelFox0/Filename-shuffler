# Filename shuffler

A program used to shuffle the file names in a folder.

It features 4 modes:   
- Shuffle 2 chosen file's names   
- Shuffle 2 random file's names   
- Shuffle 3 random file's names   
- Shuffle a custom number of files   
- SHuffle all files in a folder   

The program will ask you if you want to create an undo file. An undo file is saved in the parent directory of the chosen folder with a name like <FOLDER NAME>[custom text].undo (for example TESTFOLDER_ext.undo). It will reverse the file shuffling process.

There is also an option to tell the program that you want to only shuffle files with the same extension or not.


> But why, why does this exist?

Why not? It's just a fun project. I enjoyed making it.
